# The Vulkan Engine

Vulkan Engine (Work in Progress)

This is a personal project where I am learning Vulkan and graphics programming by following vkguide.dev

<h2><b>Current Progress</b></h2>

Basic Vulkan render loop and swapchain

Descriptor abstractions for resources

Texture loading and sampling

ImGui integration for debugging and controls

Rendering a test mesh (monkey head) with textures and an ImGui panel

<h2><b>Next Steps</b></h2>

Add materials and camera system

Load GLTF models and textures

Improve draw performance

Add basic debugging overlays (frame time, memory usage)

Explore multithreading for asset loading and scene management

Long-term: experiment with ECS and ray tracing
