# The Vulkan Engine

Vulkan Engine (Work in Progress)

This is a personal project where I am learning Vulkan and graphics programming by following vkguide.dev

Current Progress

Basic Vulkan render loop and swapchain

Descriptor abstractions for resources

Texture loading and sampling

ImGui integration for debugging and controls

Rendering a test mesh (monkey head) with textures and an ImGui panel

Next Steps

Add materials and camera system

Load GLTF models and textures

Improve draw performance

Add basic debugging overlays (frame time, memory usage)

Explore multithreading for asset loading and scene management

Long-term: experiment with ECS and ray tracing
